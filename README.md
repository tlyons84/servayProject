typically I place notes about running the code but as this is a demo project i want to put a few details about it. 

1. this is running off of index DB.
2. this project was done in 8 hours. 
3. I did not worry about the beauty of lay out that is something that can be cleaned once everything is said and done. That being said i made one additional mistake it seems in my rush to get everything done i created a few very dumb typos please forgive me. I again did not correct them as i felt it would be disgenious to do so. 
4. i built this project todisplay the power and full range of functionality of angular.
5. there is a bug on the answer set that blocks it from inserting into index db. I debated on whether or not to fix it. However i felt it disingenous to do so. Then it would not longer be an accurate display of the work. I have planned to fix this bug in a forked project.
6. currently though i am working on a rest api when time provides to enhance this. I will then retire and retool the index db.
7. here are my design notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xBWlwoz-9-qB_hIFqZeYoN2eWZHPNpiqBUpOkVJsv0I/edit?usp=sharing 
8. these arent complete notes but they will allow you to see whats going through my mind in development process. I started the project with this document and this following file. I used them as a road map to how i would go about deisgning this project. I Will tell you this is an SPA. That relies heavily on parent child communication. Forms are dyanamically driven based on user responses. 
9. Draw.io file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QFDVcZg2bHNa4NXZGcOz7wOm639FkWed/view?usp=sharing
10.please use the link above to download a draw.io document which will show you the architecture notes nd design that i employed. Again as this  was a time limited attempt some of these things i was able to get to some of them  i was not. However it will give you an idea of the depth and breath of the project.
